  I make things. I do this because it’s what I do best, and more so, I do this
  because it makes me happy. Applying my past experience to a problem and
  carefully crafting a solution. Finding a better way to do something I’ve done
  a hundred times. Exploring entirely new ideas. I strive to expand and improve
  my craft with each project. Each new project brings its own challenges and
  triumphs and, by its end, becomes another part of who I am.
